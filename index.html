        <p> My first inspiration to do Video Games was coding. when I was 6, my parents enrolled me in a clas sthat taught me coding. by the first few 5 classes, I was very intrested, and amazed to realize how everything works! after a few more classes, I wanted to play some games, and learn how code affects the games in certain ways. ever since then, I have been intrested in coding, and how games work.</p>
